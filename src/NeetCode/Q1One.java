     * Question: Two Number Sum
     * Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers
     * representing a target sum. if any two numbers in the input array sum up to
     * the target sum, the function should return them in an array, in any order. if
     * no two numbers sum up to the target sum, the function should return an empty
     * array.
     * 
     * Note that the target sum has to be obtained by summing two different integers
     * in the array; you can't add a single integer to itself in order to obtain the
     * target sum.
     * 
     * You can assume that there will be at most one pair of numbers summing up to
     * the target sum.
